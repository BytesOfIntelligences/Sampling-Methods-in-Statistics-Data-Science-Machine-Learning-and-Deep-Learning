 ### Introduction to Sampling

#### 1.1 Overview of Sampling in Statistics

Sampling in statistics involves selecting a subset of individuals from a statistical population to estimate characteristics of the whole population. Proper sampling techniques enable statisticians to make inferences about a population without examining every member.

#### 1.2 Importance of Proper Sampling

Proper sampling is crucial for several reasons:
- **Accuracy:** Ensures the sample accurately reflects the population.
- **Cost-efficiency:** Reduces the cost and time of data collection.
- **Feasibility:** Often, it’s impractical or impossible to study the entire population.

#### 1.3 Types of Sampling Errors

Two main types of errors can occur in sampling:
- **Sampling Error:** The difference between the sample statistic and the actual population parameter. Decreases as sample size increases.
- **Non-sampling Error:** Occurs due to reasons other than the sampling process, such as measurement errors or non-response biases.

#### 1.4 Key Definitions

- **Population:** The entire group about which you want to make inferences.
- **Sample:** A subset of the population selected for observation.
- **Sampling Frame:** A list or database from which the sample is drawn. Ideally, it should include the entire population.
- **Parameter:** A characteristic of the population (e.g., mean population income).
- **Statistic:** A characteristic of the sample used to estimate a population parameter (e.g., mean income of the sample).

#### 1.5 Criteria for Good Sampling

A good sampling technique should meet the following criteria:
- **Representativeness:** The sample should accurately reflect the population.
- **Randomness:** Each member of the population should have an equal chance of being selected.
- **Efficiency:** The method should yield precise estimates without unnecessary complexity or expense.
- **Practicality:** The sampling procedure should be feasible and manageable.

### Mathematical Foundations

Sampling techniques can be broadly categorized into probability sampling and non-probability sampling methods.

#### Probability Sampling

In probability sampling, each member of the population has a known, non-zero probability of selection. Examples include:

- **Simple Random Sampling (SRS):** Every subset of the population has an equal probability of being selected. The standard error for the mean \(\mu\) estimate from an SRS of size \(n\) from a population of size \(N\) with standard deviation \(\sigma\) is given by:

  ![equations](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?SE=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2}{n}\left(\frac{N-n}{N-1}\right)})

- **Stratified Sampling:** The population is divided into homogeneous subgroups, or strata, and random samples are taken from each stratum. This aims to reduce variance in the estimate.

- **Cluster Sampling:** The population is divided into clusters, and a random sample of these clusters is selected. All individuals in the selected clusters are studied.

#### Non-probability Sampling

Non-probability sampling does not give each member of the population a known chance of being included. Methods include convenience sampling, judgment sampling, and quota sampling. These methods are more prone to bias and are used when probability sampling is not feasible.


### Simple Random Sampling
Simple Random Sampling (SRS) is a sampling method in which each member of the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample. This method ensures that every possible sample of the selected size has the same chance of being chosen.

#### 2.2 Procedure for Simple Random Sampling

1. **Define the Population:** Identify the entire population from which the sample will be drawn.
2. **Determine the Sample Size:** Decide how many individuals to include in the sample.
3. **Assign Identifiers:** Assign a unique identifier to each member of the population.
4. **Use a Random Mechanism:** Use a random number generator or draw to select members based on their identifiers.

- **Python Code for SRS:**
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the population as an array of identifiers
population = np.arange(1, 101)  # For a population of 100 individuals

# Determine the sample size
sample_size = 10

# Generate a random sample
sample = np.random.choice(population, size=sample_size, replace=False)

print("Sample:", sample)
```

#### 2.3 Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**
- **Unbiasedness:** Every member has an equal chance of selection, minimizing bias.
- **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and implement.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Not Feasible for Large Populations:** Can be impractical for very large populations due to the need for a complete list of the population.
- **Randomness Requirement:** Requires a truly random selection mechanism, which can be difficult to achieve in practice.

#### 2.4 Examples of Simple Random Sampling

1. **Educational Research:** Selecting a random sample of students from a school to assess the overall academic performance.
2. **Health Surveys:** Randomly selecting individuals from a community to study dietary habits.

#### 2.5 Challenges and Considerations

- **Accurate Population List:** Requires a comprehensive and up-to-date list of the entire population.
- **Random Selection Mechanism:** Ensuring the selection process is truly random to avoid bias.
- **Sample Size Determination:** Balancing between the cost of data collection and the precision of the estimates. The sample size can significantly affect the standard error of the estimate.

- **Python Code for Sample Size Determination:**
```python
def calculate_sample_size(population_size, margin_error=0.05,
  std_dev=0.5, 
  z_score=1.96):
    """
    Calculate the required sample size.
    """
    numerator = (z_score**2) *
  (std_dev**2) * (population_size)
    denominator = ((margin_error**2) * (population_size-1))
  + ((z_score**2) * (std_dev**2))
    sample_size = numerator / denominator
    return round(sample_size)

population_size = 10000  # Example population size
required_sample_size = calculate_sample_size(population_size)
print("Required Sample Size:", required_sample_size)
```

This function calculates the required sample size given a population size, desired margin of error, standard deviation (as an estimate of variability within the population), and Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level.

Simple random sampling represents a fundamental approach in statistical sampling, offering a balance between simplicity and rigor in drawing unbiased samples from populations.  
  
### Stratified Random Sampling

#### 3.1 Definition and Concept

Stratified random sampling is a method of sampling that involves dividing a population into smaller groups, known as strata, which share similar characteristics. Within each stratum, random samples are taken. This method aims to minimize sampling bias and variance.

- **Mathematical Basis:** The population is divided into \(H\) non-overlapping strata. From each stratum \(h\), a simple random sample of size \(n_h\) is drawn. The total sample size is ![equations](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\(n=\sum_{h=1}^{H}n_h\)).

#### 3.2 Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages:**
  - Reduces sampling error by ensuring all subgroups are represented.
  - Increases precision without necessarily increasing the sample size.
  
- **Disadvantages:**
  - More complex and time-consuming than simple random sampling.
  - Requires detailed information about the population to form strata.

#### 3.3 Procedure for Stratified Random Sampling

1. **Define Strata:** The population is divided into distinct strata based on known attributes.
2. **Determine Sample Size for Each Stratum:** This can be proportional to the stratum size or equal for each stratum.
3. **Random Sampling:** Conduct simple random sampling within each stratum.
4. **Data Analysis:** Analyze the collected data, taking into account the stratified design.

#### 3.4 Examples of Stratified Random Sampling

Let's simulate a stratified random sampling process using Python:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Simulate a population data
np.random.seed(0)
population_size = 1000
population_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'ID': range(1, population_size + 1),
    'Age': np.random.choice(['18-25', '26-35',
  '36-45', '46-55', '56+'], size=population_size,
  p=[0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.15, 0.1]),
    'Income': np.random.normal(loc=50000, scale=15000,
  size=population_size)
})

# Define strata based on age group
strata = population_data.groupby('Age')

# Determine sample size for each stratum
 # For simplicity, equal size from each stratum  
sample_size_per_stratum = 50 

# Perform stratified random sampling
sample = pd.DataFrame()
for _, group in strata:
    sample = pd.concat([sample, group.sample(sample_size_per_stratum)])

print(sample.head())
```

#### 3.5 Use Cases and Considerations

- **Use Cases:**
  - Market research studies where consumers are divided into different demographic groups.
  - Clinical trials where patients are stratified by disease severity or age.
  
- **Considerations:**
  - The strata must be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.
  - Stratification variables should be strongly related to the key variables of interest in the study.
  - The method of allocating sample sizes to strata (e.g., proportional allocation or equal allocation) impacts the analysis.

Stratified random sampling is a powerful tool for ensuring diverse subgroups within a population are adequately represented, leading to more reliable and valid statistical inferences.  
  
### Systematic Sampling

Systematic sampling is a statistical method where elements are selected from an ordered sampling frame. The process starts by selecting a random point within the first interval, and then every \(k^{th}\) element is chosen after the initial point. This method is often used when a complete list of all members of the population is available.

#### 4.2 Procedure for Systematic Sampling

1. **Determine the Sample Size (\(n\))**: Decide how many observations are needed for the sample.
2. **Calculate the Sampling Interval (\(k\))**: This is done by dividing the population size (\(N\)) by the desired sample size ![equations](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(\(n\)).\(k=\frac{N}{n}\)).
3. **Select the Starting Point**: Randomly select an integer between 1 and \(k\) as the starting point.
4. **Select Every ![equations](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\(k^{th}\)) Element**: From the starting point, select every ![equations](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\(k^{th}\)) element in the population list until the desired sample size is reached.

#### 4.3 Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages:**
  - Simple and easy to implement.
  - Ensures a spread across the population, reducing the risk of bias in clustered populations.
  
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Risk of introducing periodicity bias, where the pattern of the list influences the sample.
  - Not as random as simple random sampling, since after the first random pick, the rest are automatically determined.

#### 4.4 Examples of Systematic Sampling

An example might include surveying households in a large apartment complex. If the complex has 1000 apartments and you want a sample of 100, you would sample every 10th apartment (\(k = 1000 / 100 = 10\)) after a random start between 1 and 10.

#### 4.5 Implementation Considerations

- **Random Start**: The choice of the starting point is crucial to ensure randomness.
- **Sampling Interval**: The interval must be consistent throughout the sampling process.
- **Periodicity**: Be wary of periodic patterns in the population that might coincide with the sampling interval, as this could lead to biased samples.

### Python Code Example for Systematic Sampling

Let's implement systematic sampling on a hypothetical population:

```python
import numpy as np

def systematic_sampling(data, sample_size):
    N = len(data)
    k = N // sample_size  # Determine the sampling interval
    start = np.random.randint(0, k)  # Random start within the first interval
    indices = range(start, N, k)  # Calculate indices for systematic sampling
    systematic_sample = data[indices]
    return systematic_sample

# Example: Systematic sampling from a population of 1000 elements
population = np.arange(1, 1001)  # A population from 1 to 1000
sample_size = 100  # Desired sample size

sample = systematic_sampling(population, sample_size)
print("Sampled Indices:", sample)
```

This code demonstrates how to perform systematic sampling from a given population array. It selects a random starting point within the first sampling interval and then selects every ![equations](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\(k^{th}\)) element to form the sample.  
  
  
### Cluster Sampling
Cluster sampling is a type of sampling method where the entire population is divided into groups, or clusters, and a random selection of these clusters is chosen for a detailed study. Unlike stratified sampling, where each stratum is sampled, in cluster sampling, only selected clusters are studied, and all elements within these clusters are included in the sample.

#### 5.2 Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages:**
  - **Cost-Efficiency:** Reduces travel and logistical costs significantly when the population is geographically dispersed.
  - **Practicality:** Simplifies the sampling process when a complete list of the population members is not available but a list of clusters is.
  - **Scalability:** Easily scalable to larger populations without a substantial increase in operational complexity.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Increased Variability:** May increase the sampling error compared to simple random sampling due to the heterogeneity within clusters.
  - **Cluster Selection Bias:** The choice of clusters can introduce bias if the clusters are not representative of the population.
  - **Analysis Complexity:** Analyzing data from cluster samples can be more complex, especially if clusters vary significantly in size.

#### 5.3 Procedure for Cluster Sampling

1. **Define the Clusters:** Divide the entire population into clusters that collectively encompass the whole population. Clusters should ideally be as heterogeneous as possible, each representing the population.
2. **Select Clusters Randomly:** Choose a subset of clusters using a random method. The selection can be proportional to the cluster size or equal probability for each cluster.
3. **Conduct the Survey Within Chosen Clusters:** Collect data from all units within the selected clusters. Every member of the chosen clusters is included in the sample.

#### 5.4 Examples of Cluster Sampling

- **Geographic Clustering:** A national health survey could divide the country into regions (clusters) and then randomly select regions to conduct the survey. All individuals in the selected regions would be surveyed.
- **School Surveys:** When assessing educational programs, schools may serve as clusters. A random selection of schools would be made, and all students or teachers within those schools would be included in the study.

#### 5.5 Practical Considerations and Challenges

- **Cluster Definition:** Clusters must be clearly defined and cover the entire population to avoid selection bias.
- **Random Selection:** The method for randomly selecting clusters needs to ensure each cluster has a known probability of being chosen.
- **Homogeneity:** While clusters themselves should be heterogeneous, there should be homogeneity among the members within each cluster to minimize intra-cluster variability.
- **Sample Size:** The number of clusters chosen and the size of each cluster can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of the results. Larger samples from each cluster can reduce error but at a higher cost.

### Python Code Example for Cluster Sampling

Let's simulate cluster sampling on a hypothetical dataset:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Simulate data for 1000 individuals across 50 clusters (e.g., villages)
np.random.seed(42)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'individual_id': range(1000),
    'cluster_id': np.repeat(range(50), 20),  
  # 50 clusters, 20 individuals each
    'response': np.random.rand(1000)
})

# Define number of clusters to sample
num_clusters_to_sample = 10

# Randomly select clusters
selected_clusters = np.random.choice(data['cluster_id'].unique(),
  num_clusters_to_sample, 
  replace=False)

# Sample data
cluster_sample = data[data['cluster_id'].isin(selected_clusters)]

print(cluster_sample.head())
```

The provided code exemplifies the process of cluster sampling in Python, wherein a subset of clusters is chosen from a larger dataset and every individual within that cluster is incorporated into the sample.

  
  
### Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) Sampling

Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling is a sampling technique where the selection probability for each unit in the population is proportional to its size measure, relative to the total sum of the sizes. This method is often used when units in the population vary significantly in size, and the size is believed to be correlated with the measure of interest.

#### 6.2 Procedure for PPS Sampling

1. **Define the Size Measure:** Identify a relevant size measure for each unit in the population. This could be revenue for businesses, population size for geographic regions, etc.
   
2. **Calculate Selection Probabilities:** The probability of selecting each unit is calculated as the ratio of its size to the total size of all units.
   
3. **Random Selection:** Units are selected for the sample based on their selection probabilities. Techniques such as systematic PPS sampling can be used, where units are selected systematically with intervals based on cumulative selection probabilities.

4. **Data Collection and Weighting:** Collect data from the selected units. Estimates from the sample are typically weighted inversely by the selection probability to make them representative of the population.

#### 6.3 Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages:**
  - **Efficiency:** More efficient than simple random sampling when there is a wide variation in size among units.
  - **Representativeness:** Ensures large units are included in the sample, potentially improving the representativeness of the sample for certain variables.
  
- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Complexity:** More complex to implement than simple random sampling, requiring additional information about the population.
  - **Bias Risk:** If size is not well-correlated with the variable of interest, PPS sampling could introduce bias.

#### 6.4 Examples of PPS Sampling

- **Surveying Businesses:** In a survey where businesses are units, a business’s number of employees might be used as a size measure. Larger businesses have a higher probability of being selected.
  
- **Environmental Studies:** In studying water usage across regions, the selection probability for each region might be proportional to its population size or geographical area.

#### 6.5 Applications and Best Practices

- **Applications:**
  - Widely used in sociological and market research, environmental studies, and any field where units of analysis vary greatly in size.
  
- **Best Practices:**
  - Carefully define the size measure to ensure it is correlated with the study variables of interest.
  - Consider using auxiliary information to adjust for potential biases introduced by the size measure.
  - Ensure a minimum sample size for smaller units to avoid their underrepresentation.

### Python Code Example for PPS Sampling

Here's a simplified example of implementing PPS sampling in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Example data: 10 units with varying sizes
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'unit_id': range(1, 11),
    'size': [5, 15, 25, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 45, 35]
})

# Calculate selection probabilities
data['selection_prob'] = data['size'] / data['size'].sum()

# Cumulative sum for systematic selection
data['cumulative_prob'] = data['selection_prob'].cumsum()

# Select units using systematic PPS
np.random.seed(42)
start_point = np.random.uniform(0, 1 / len(data))
intervals = start_point + np.arange(len(data)) / len(data)
selected_units = data[data['cumulative_prob'].ge(intervals)].
  reset_index(drop=True)

print(selected_units)
```

Here we have an example of code that systematically selects units according to their size-dependent probability. Keep in mind that larger and more complicated populations may need more complex processes for real PPS sampling in practice. 
  
### Convenience Sampling
Convenience sampling, also known as grab or opportunity sampling, is a non-probability sampling technique where samples are selected based on their availability or ease of access. The primary criterion for inclusion in the sample is convenience for the researcher.

#### 7.2 Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages:**
  - **Cost-Effective and Time-Saving:** It significantly reduces the costs and time associated with data collection.
  - **Ease of Access:** Allows for quick gathering of initial data where the speed of collection is more critical than the sample's representativeness.
  - **Simplicity:** The method is straightforward to implement, requiring minimal planning and no complex sampling frames.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - **High Risk of Bias:** The sample may not be representative of the population, leading to biased results that cannot be generalized.
  - **Limited Research Use:** Findings from convenience samples are often questioned due to the potential for bias.
  - **Lack of Control Over Sampling Error:** Since the sample is not randomly selected, it's difficult to estimate or control for sampling error.

#### 7.3 Procedure for Convenience Sampling

1. **Identify a Convenient Population:** Select a population that is easily accessible.
2. **Select Sample Members:** Choose individuals who are most convenient to reach. This often means selecting those who are physically or digitally nearest to the researcher.
3. **Collect Data:** Proceed with data collection from the selected sample.
4. **Analysis and Reporting:** Analyze the data while acknowledging the limitations of convenience sampling in your findings.

#### 7.4 Examples of Convenience Sampling

- **Street Surveys:** Researchers may choose to survey people on a busy street corner because they are readily available.
- **Online Surveys:** Sending surveys to an existing email list or through social media, reaching those who are easiest to contact.
- **Student Experiments:** Using students from a researcher’s class as subjects due to their accessibility.

#### 7.5 Use Cases and Ethical Considerations

- **Use Cases:**
  - **Exploratory Research:** When seeking initial insights into a research problem or hypothesis.
  - **Pilot Studies:** Testing research instruments or experimental designs before conducting a larger study.
  - **Case Studies:** In-depth study of a particular group, situation, or individual where representativeness is not the primary goal.

- **Ethical Considerations:**
  - **Informed Consent:** Ensure participants are fully informed about the study's purpose and their role.
  - **Voluntariness:** Participation should be voluntary, without undue pressure or coercion.
  - **Transparency:** Be transparent about the sampling method’s limitations when reporting findings.
  - **Avoid Harm:** Carefully consider and mitigate any potential harm to participants arising from the research.

Convenience sampling can be a useful tool in specific contexts, particularly for exploratory research or when other sampling methods are not feasible. However, the limitations and potential for bias must be carefully considered when interpreting and generalizing findings from such samples.  
  
### Purposive Sampling

Purposive sampling, also known as judgmental, selective, or subjective sampling, is a type of non-probability sampling where the researcher selects the sample based on their judgment about who will be most informative for the research. Unlike probability sampling, where each member of the population has a known chance of selection, purposive sampling targets a specific group of people or entities that meet a defined criterion related to the research question.

#### 8.2 Procedure for Purposive Sampling

1. **Define Objectives:** Clearly define the objectives of the study and identify the characteristics that make certain participants particularly useful.
2. **Identify Criteria:** Establish criteria that participants must meet to be included in the sample. These criteria should align with the research objectives.
3. **Select Participants:** Based on the defined criteria, select individuals or entities that provide the most valuable information for your study.
4. **Review and Adjust:** As data is collected, continuously evaluate if the selected sample effectively addresses the research questions. Adjust the criteria or sample as necessary.

#### 8.3 Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages:**
  - **Focused Insights:** Enables in-depth exploration of specific phenomena or characteristics identified by the researcher.
  - **Flexibility:** Allows researchers to adapt and refine their sampling strategy as the study progresses.
  - **Cost and Time Efficiency:** Reduces the resources required to study a broad population when only a specific subgroup is of interest.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - **High Risk of Bias:** The subjective nature of sample selection increases the risk of bias, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings.
  - **Lack of Representativeness:** May not accurately represent the broader population, especially if the criteria for selection are too narrow.
  - **Dependence on Researcher Judgment:** The quality of the sample heavily relies on the researcher's ability to identify representative participants.

#### 8.4 Examples of Purposive Sampling

- **Expert Interviews:** Selecting industry experts to gain deep insights into a particular field.
- **Case Studies:** Identifying specific organizations, communities, or events that exemplify the phenomenon under investigation.
- **Special Populations:** Researching rare conditions or behaviors by specifically targeting individuals who exhibit these traits.

#### 8.5 When to Use Purposive Sampling

Purposive sampling is particularly useful in qualitative research when:
- The focus is on gaining deep insights into specific phenomena rather than generalizing findings to a broader population.
- The research involves studying rare or unique cases that cannot be easily identified through random sampling methods.
- Resources are limited, and the study requires participants with specific expertise, characteristics, or experiences.

Purposive sampling provides a pragmatic method for obtaining comprehensive, intricate, and pertinent data that is directly linked to the study goals. Nevertheless, it is important to interpret the acquired knowledge in light of the specific group of individuals studied, taking into account the possibility of prejudice and the difficulties in applying the results to a broader population.

  
### 9. Snowball Sampling

Snowball sampling, also known as chain-referral sampling, is a non-probability sampling technique used in research when potential respondents are hard to locate or reach. It relies on initial subjects to identify additional subjects among their acquaintances, thus, the sample size grows like a snowball. This method is particularly useful for studying hidden populations or communities that are difficult for researchers to access directly.

#### 9.2 Procedure for Snowball Sampling

1. **Identify Initial Participants:** Start with a small group of participants who meet the study criteria.
2. **Ask for Referrals:** Request these initial participants to refer others they know who also meet the criteria.
3. **Expand the Sample:** Contact the referred individuals, enroll them in the study, and ask for further referrals.
4. **Repeat:** Continue this process until sufficient data has been collected or the network of referrals ends.
5. **Analyze the Data:** Given the non-random nature of the sampling, special attention should be paid to the analysis and interpretation phase, acknowledging the sampling method's limitations.

#### 9.3 Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages:**
  - **Access to Hidden Populations:** Enables researchers to reach populations that are otherwise inaccessible.
  - **Cost-Effective:** Reduces the cost and time involved in locating participants for hard-to-reach groups.
  - **Flexibility:** Can be adapted and used in various fields and for different research topics.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Sample Bias:** The sample may not be representative of the entire population, leading to biased results.
  - **Dependence on Subjects:** The success of the method heavily relies on the willingness of participants to refer others.
  - **Ethical Concerns:** The process may raise ethical issues, especially concerning privacy and consent.

#### 9.4 Examples of Snowball Sampling

- **Studying Rare Diseases:** Researchers studying a rare medical condition use snowball sampling to identify patients through healthcare providers and patient networks.
- **Social Network Analysis:** When exploring the characteristics or behaviors within specific social groups, such as undocumented immigrants or specific professional networks.
- **Qualitative Market Research:** Companies looking to understand niche markets may use snowball sampling to gather insights from a small, targeted group of consumers.

#### 9.5 Applications and Challenges

- **Applications:** Snowball sampling is widely used in sociology, psychology, public health, and marketing research, especially when the population under study is a small, discrete group that members can best identify.
  
- **Challenges:**
  - **Representativeness:** Ensuring the sample broadly represents the population can be challenging due to the method's reliance on personal networks.
  - **Ethical Considerations:** Maintaining confidentiality and obtaining informed consent are crucial, given the personal and often sensitive nature of the information and referrals.
  - **Data Quality:** There's a risk that the data collected may be homogeneous or biased due to the overlapping social circles from which participants are drawn.


Snowball sampling is a valuable approach used in qualitative research and exploratory investigations when other sampling techniques are not feasible. Nevertheless, researchers must meticulously consider the constraints and ethical ramifications associated with their study design and result interpretation.  
  
### 10. Quota Sampling

Quota sampling is a non-probability sampling technique where the researcher divides the population into exclusive subgroups, then determines a quota for each subgroup to ensure the sample reflects certain characteristics of the population. The selection of participants within each subgroup is non-random, based on convenience or judgment.

#### 10.2 Procedure for Quota Sampling

1. **Identify Strata:** The population is segmented into different strata based on specific characteristics relevant to the research study (e.g., age, gender, income level).
2. **Determine Quotas:** For each stratum, quotas are established that reflect the proportions of these characteristics in the target population.
3. **Select Participants:** Researchers fill the quotas for each stratum using non-random selection methods until the desired sample size is reached.

#### 10.3 Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages:**
  - **Efficiency:** Quota sampling can be implemented quickly and is cost-effective, especially when the sample needs to be representative of certain characteristics.
  - **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and can be conducted without a complete list of the population.
  - **Flexibility:** Researchers can adjust the quotas and selection criteria as the sampling progresses.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Bias:** The non-random selection process can introduce bias, as the sample may not be representative of the broader population beyond the quota characteristics.
  - **Sampling Error:** Difficult to estimate the sampling error because the sample is not randomly selected.
  - **Over-Representation:** Some groups may be over-represented due to the non-random selection process, especially if the quotas are not set correctly.

#### 10.4 Examples of Quota Sampling

- **Market Research:** A company conducting market research may use quota sampling to ensure their sample includes a proportional representation of different age groups, genders, and income levels of their target market.
- **Opinion Polls:** Media outlets conducting opinion polls might use quota sampling to quickly gather opinions from a sample that mirrors the demographic composition of a city or country.

#### 10.5 Comparisons with Other Sampling Methods

- **Quota vs. Stratified Sampling:** Both involve dividing the population into strata. However, stratified sampling requires random selection within each stratum, while quota sampling does not.
- **Quota vs. Convenience Sampling:** Both are non-probability sampling methods. Convenience sampling involves selecting whoever is conveniently available, without attempting to make the sample representative of specific population characteristics.
- **Quota vs. Simple Random Sampling:** Simple random sampling gives each member of the population an equal chance of being selected, unlike quota sampling, which focuses on representation of characteristics rather than randomness.


Quota sampling is especially advantageous in exploratory research in situations where there are constraints on time and resources. Nevertheless, the absence of randomization in quota sampling research necessitates careful interpretation of the results, especially when considering their applicability to the whole population.  
  
  
### 11. Adaptive Sampling

Adaptive sampling is a sampling strategy where the method for selecting samples can change during the course of the data collection based on the information gathered from earlier samples. This approach is particularly useful in populations with high variability or when the population is not well understood beforehand. It allows researchers to 'adapt' their sampling strategy to focus on areas of interest or higher variability as they learn more about the population's characteristics.

#### 11.2 Procedure for Adaptive Sampling

1. **Initial Sampling:** Begin with a preliminary sample, often selected randomly or through another basic sampling method, to gain initial insights into the population.
2. **Data Evaluation:** Analyze the data from the initial sample to identify patterns, clusters, or areas of high variability.
3. **Adjust Sampling Strategy:** Based on the initial findings, modify the sampling criteria to target specific subpopulations, areas, or characteristics more intensively.
4. **Iterate:** Continue the process of sampling, evaluating, and adjusting until sufficient data has been collected to meet the research objectives.

#### 11.3 Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages:**
  - **Efficiency:** Can be more efficient than traditional sampling methods because it focuses resources on the most informative parts of the population.
  - **Flexibility:** Adapts to findings in real-time, allowing researchers to explore unexpected results or areas of high variability.
  - **Reduced Bias:** By focusing on under-sampled or highly variable areas, it can reduce bias and improve the representativeness of the sample.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Complexity:** More complex to design and implement than standard sampling methods, requiring sophisticated analysis and decision-making processes.
  - **Potential for Bias:** If not carefully managed, the adaptive aspect can introduce bias, particularly if the adaptation criteria are not well defined.
  - **Data Dependency:** The success of the method depends heavily on the quality and interpretability of the initial data.

#### 11.4 Examples of Adaptive Sampling

- **Environmental Studies:** In exploring biodiversity in a large geographic area, initial samples might show certain regions with higher species diversity. Subsequent sampling efforts could then be concentrated in these regions.
- **Clinical Trials:** If initial results of a trial indicate higher efficacy in a specific subgroup of patients, further sampling might focus on similar subgroups to refine understanding and recommendations.

#### 11.5 Applications and Considerations

- **Applications:** Adaptive sampling is used in environmental science, biological studies, marketing research, and any field where the population is heterogeneous, and the research aims to efficiently capture variability.
  
- **Considerations:**
  - **Sampling Plan:** A clear, flexible plan is needed that outlines how adaptations will be made based on the data.
  - **Statistical Analysis:** Special statistical techniques may be required to analyze data from adaptive sampling to account for the changing sampling strategy.
  - **Ethical Concerns:** In human research, ensure that the adaptation criteria do not lead to unfair exclusion or inclusion that could affect the validity or ethics of the study.

Adaptive sampling is a method of study that enables targeted and efficient data collecting in populations that are complicated or not well known. Nonetheless, the efficacy of the approach relies on meticulous strategizing, implementation, and evaluation, while being cognizant of the likelihood of prejudice and intricacy.  

  
### 12. Multistage Sampling

Multistage sampling is a complex form of cluster sampling. It involves the selection of samples in multiple stages, allowing for a more manageable and cost-effective approach to sampling large and geographically dispersed populations. It's particularly useful when a complete list of the population members is not available, but lists exist for larger groups or clusters.

#### 12.2 Procedure for Multistage Sampling

1. **First Stage:** The population is divided into first-level clusters (e.g., states or provinces), and a random sample of these clusters is selected.
2. **Subsequent Stages:** Within each selected cluster, further sub-sampling is conducted. This may involve selecting sub-clusters (e.g., cities within states) in the second stage, and then individual units (e.g., households) in the final stage.
3. **Sampling within Clusters:** At each stage, either a simple random sample or another sampling method can be used to select smaller units until the desired level of individual units is reached.

#### 12.3 Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages:**
  - **Cost-Effectiveness:** Reduces travel and administrative costs by limiting the scope of the study to selected clusters in each stage.
  - **Scalability:** Easily scalable to very large populations across extensive geographic areas.
  - **Flexibility:** Allows researchers to apply different sampling techniques at different stages.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Increased Complexity:** More complex to organize and execute than single-stage sampling methods.
  - **Potential for Higher Sampling Error:** Each stage of sampling can introduce error, potentially leading to higher cumulative sampling error.
  - **Sample Representativeness:** Ensuring representativeness can be challenging, especially if the initial clusters are not well-defined.

#### 12.4 Examples of Multistage Sampling

- **National Health Surveys:** A country might be divided into regions, from which a sample of cities is selected, and within each city, specific households might be chosen.
- **Educational Research:** Schools within districts are selected randomly, and within each selected school, a sample of classrooms is chosen for the study.

#### 12.5 Practical Considerations

- **Design:** Careful planning is required to ensure that each stage of sampling contributes to the overall study objectives without introducing undue bias.
- **Cluster Selection:** The method for selecting clusters at each stage should consider the study's goals, whether aiming for representativeness or focusing on specific subgroups.
- **Sample Size:** At each stage, the sample size needs to be determined based on the level of precision required for the study and the budgetary constraints.
- **Weighting:** The analysis may require weighting to adjust for the multistage design, especially if different probabilities of selection are used at different stages.

Multistage sampling represents a versatile and efficient approach for studying large and diverse populations. However, its success relies heavily on careful design and execution, with particular attention to the selection methods used at each stage and the potential accumulation of sampling errors.  

  
  
### 13. Random Sampling vs Non-Random Sampling

#### 13.1 Key Differences

- **Selection Method:**
  - **Random Sampling:** Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. Techniques include simple random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling.
  - **Non-Random Sampling:** Selection is based on criteria set by the researcher or convenience, not chance. Techniques include quota sampling, convenience sampling, and purposive sampling.

- **Bias and Representativeness:**
  - **Random Sampling:** Minimizes bias and enhances the representativeness of the sample, allowing for generalizations to the population.
  - **Non-Random Sampling:** Higher risk of bias, which may limit the ability to generalize findings to the broader population.

- **Data Collection Cost and Feasibility:**
  - **Random Sampling:** Often more time-consuming and costly but provides a more accurate reflection of the population.
  - **Non-Random Sampling:** More cost-effective and quicker to implement, suitable for exploratory research or when the population is hard to access.

#### 13.2 When to Use Random Sampling

Random sampling is preferred when:
- The objective is to generalize findings to a larger population.
- The research budget and timeline allow for a more rigorous data collection process.
- The population is well-defined, and a sampling frame is available.
- Minimizing sampling bias is crucial for the research outcomes.

#### 13.3 When to Use Non-Random Sampling

Non-random sampling is useful:
- In exploratory stages of research where the goal is to develop hypotheses rather than test them.
- When the population is difficult to access, and a sampling frame is not available.
- For qualitative research focusing on depth and detail of specific phenomena rather than generalization.
- Under tight budgetary or time constraints.

#### 13.4 Combining Methods for Improved Results

Combining random and non-random sampling methods can leverage the strengths of each approach, improving the robustness and depth of research findings. For instance:
- **Stratified Sampling with Purposive Selection:** Use random sampling to select strata and then purposively select subjects within each stratum to ensure that specific subgroups are adequately represented.
- **Two-Stage Sampling with Convenience Selection:** Initially use random sampling to select clusters and then apply convenience sampling within each cluster to quickly gather data.

### Combining Sampling Methods: Practical Considerations

- **Research Objectives:** The choice of sampling method should align with the research objectives, whether they prioritize generalizability or depth of understanding.
- **Population Structure:** Understanding the structure and distribution of the population can guide the choice between or combination of sampling methods.
- **Resource Availability:** Budget and time constraints often dictate the feasibility of certain sampling methods over others.

By thoughtfully combining sampling methods, researchers can balance the need for representativeness, depth of insight, and practical constraints, enhancing the overall quality and relevance of their findings. 
  
  
### 14. Sampling in Experimental Design

Experimental design is a critical component of research that aims to establish cause-and-effect relationships. The choice of sampling method significantly influences the validity and reliability of the study's findings.

#### 14.1 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)

- **Definition:** RCTs are considered the gold standard in experimental design. Participants are randomly assigned to either the treatment group receiving the intervention or the control group receiving a placebo or standard treatment. This random assignment helps ensure that the groups are comparable at the start of the experiment.
  
- **Sampling in RCTs:** 
  - **Random Sampling:** Ideally, participants are selected through a random sampling method from the target population to ensure the study results are generalizable.
  - **Random Assignment:** Crucial for minimizing selection bias and confounding variables, enhancing the internal validity of the experiment.

#### 14.2 Quasi-Experimental Designs

- **Definition:** Quasi-experimental designs do not use random assignment. Instead, groups are formed based on existing differences or by the researcher's intervention without randomization, such as assigning schools to different educational interventions based on location.
  
- **Sampling in Quasi-Experiments:** 
  - **Non-Random Sampling:** Often involves convenience or purposive sampling, as the groups may be pre-determined by non-random criteria.
  - **Implications:** The lack of random assignment can introduce selection bias, making it harder to infer causality confidently.

#### 14.3 Cross-Sectional Studies

- **Definition:** Cross-sectional studies observe a specific outcome or variable of interest in a sample from the target population at one particular point in time. These studies are descriptive and can identify associations but not causal relationships.
  
- **Sampling in Cross-Sectional Studies:** 
  - **Variety of Sampling Methods:** Can use random sampling for generalizability or non-random sampling for specific subgroups or practical considerations.
  - **Snapshot Approach:** Since these studies do not track changes over time, the sampling method should ensure a representative snapshot of the population at the time of the study.

#### 14.4 Longitudinal Studies

- **Definition:** Longitudinal studies follow the same subjects over a period, observing changes or outcomes. This design can be observational or involve interventions.
  
- **Sampling in Longitudinal Studies:** 
  - **Cohort Sampling:** Subjects (a cohort) are often selected through random sampling to be representative of the population. 
  - **Panel Sampling:** In some cases, a panel of participants is selected to represent various subgroups within the population.
  - **Attrition Considerations:** Longitudinal studies must account for attrition by ensuring the initial sample is large enough to maintain statistical power over time or by employing strategies to minimize dropout rates.

### 15. Sampling Considerations Across Designs

#### 15.1 Designing Survey Sampling Plans

Designing an effective survey sampling plan involves several key steps to ensure that the collected data accurately represents the target population and meets the research objectives.

- **Define the Target Population:** Clearly identify who you want to study. This could range from a specific demographic group to the entire population of a country.
- **Choose a Sampling Frame:** The sampling frame is a list from which potential survey respondents are selected. It should closely match the target population to minimize coverage error.
- **Select a Sampling Method:** Decide between probability (e.g., simple random, stratified, cluster) and non-probability sampling methods (e.g., convenience, quota). The choice depends on the research goals, budget, and time constraints.
- **Determine Sample Size:** Calculate the sample size needed to achieve the desired level of precision and confidence in the results. This involves statistical formulas that account for the expected variability in the data and the design effect of the chosen sampling method.
- **Implement Sampling Plan:** Execute the sampling process according to the chosen method, ensuring that the selection is unbiased and that the respondents accurately represent the target population.

#### 15.2 Survey Sampling Errors

Two main types of errors can affect the accuracy of survey results: sampling errors and non-sampling errors.

- **Sampling Error:** Arises from using a sample to estimate characteristics of a larger population. The size of the sampling error typically decreases as the sample size increases. It is quantifiable and can be reduced through careful design and larger sample sizes.
- **Non-Sampling Error:** Includes all other errors that can occur in the survey process, such as measurement error, nonresponse error, and coverage error. These errors are not directly related to the sample size and must be addressed through careful questionnaire design, effective communication with respondents, and rigorous data collection procedures.

#### 15.3 Online Surveys and Sampling

Online surveys have become increasingly popular due to their cost-effectiveness and rapid deployment. However, sampling for online surveys presents unique challenges.

- **Sampling Frame and Coverage:** For online surveys, the sampling frame often consists of email lists or online panels, which may not fully represent the target population.
- **Self-Selection Bias:** Self-selection into the survey can lead to bias, as individuals who choose to participate may differ significantly from those who do not.
- **Strategies for Improvement:** Use mixed-mode approaches to include respondents without internet access, apply post-stratification weighting to adjust for known differences between the sample and the population, and utilize online panels that are carefully constructed to be representative.

#### 15.4 Telephone Surveys and Sampling

Telephone surveys, once a staple of survey research, face challenges from declining response rates and the shift from landlines to mobile phones.

- **Random Digit Dialing (RDD):** Used to create a sample of telephone numbers, both landline and mobile. This method ensures that unlisted numbers have a chance of being included.
- **Coverage Issues:** The shift to mobile phones has created coverage issues, as individuals using only mobile phones may differ demographically from those with landlines.
- **Strategies for Improvement:** Incorporate both landline and mobile phone numbers in the sampling frame, use dual-frame sampling designs to cover both types of users, and apply weighting to adjust for differential response rates and coverage errors.

In survey research, the choice of sampling method and design is crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable data. Understanding and minimizing potential errors through careful planning and execution can significantly enhance the quality of survey findings.- **Generalizability vs. Specificity:** The choice between random and non-random sampling methods often balances the desire for generalizable findings and the need to study specific groups or phenomena.
- **Ethical and Practical Constraints:** Ethical considerations and practical limitations, such as resource constraints, can influence the choice of sampling method.
- **Data Quality and Reliability:** Regardless of the design, ensuring high-quality and reliable data collection methods is paramount, as this directly affects the study's conclusions and impact.

Sampling strategies play a pivotal role in the design and execution of experimental and observational studies, influencing the scope of conclusions and the applicability of findings to wider populations.

### 18. Typical Traps in the Process of Sampling


Sampling is a fundamental aspect of research methodology that, if not properly conducted, can lead to significant biases and errors in research findings. Understanding and mitigating common pitfalls in sampling are crucial for ensuring the reliability and validity of study results.

#### 18.1 Selection Bias

- **Definition:** Selection bias occurs when the process of selecting a sample causes it to be unrepresentative of the population, systematically favoring certain outcomes.
- **Causes:** Can arise from the non-random selection of participants, such as using convenience sampling without accounting for its limitations or allowing participants to self-select into the study.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Use random sampling techniques where feasible, ensure the sampling frame accurately represents the population, and apply weighting adjustments to correct for known biases.

#### 18.2 Non-response Bias

- **Definition:** Non-response bias happens when individuals selected for the sample do not participate or respond, and their non-participation is related to the study's outcome of interest.
- **Causes:** Common in surveys and studies where participation is voluntary. Higher occurrence when the survey is long, complicated, or sensitive in nature.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Improve survey design to be more engaging and less burdensome, offer incentives for participation, conduct follow-ups with non-respondents, and apply statistical adjustments based on the characteristics of respondents vs. non-respondents.

#### 18.3 Sampling Frame Errors

- **Definition:** Sampling frame errors occur when the list or database from which the sample is drawn (the sampling frame) does not accurately reflect the population.
- **Causes:** Outdated or incomplete lists, missing segments of the population, or incorrect definitions of the population.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update and validate the sampling frame, use multiple sources to compile the frame, and clearly define the population to ensure the frame's coverage is as comprehensive as possible.

#### 18.4 Coverage Errors

- **Definition:** Coverage errors happen when the sampling frame does not include all elements of the target population, leading to an under-representation of some groups.
- **Causes:** Similar to sampling frame errors, but specifically refers to the absence of segments of the population from the frame.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Identify and include all segments of the population in the sampling frame, utilize supplementary frames to cover missing populations, and employ stratified or cluster sampling to ensure all groups are represented.

### Best Practices to Avoid Pitfalls

- **Thorough Planning:** Careful design of the study and sampling methodology can preempt many common sampling errors.
- **Pilot Testing:** Conduct pilot studies to identify and address potential biases and errors in the sampling process.
- **Transparency:** Document the sampling process, including the rationale for the chosen method, details of the implementation, and any issues encountered, to allow for critical evaluation of the study's findings.
- **Statistical Adjustments:** Use statistical techniques to adjust for known biases, such as weighting and imputation for missing data.

----------------------------------------------------
  
  ## 1. Random Sampling:


```python
import random

# Define the population
population = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Specify the sample size
sample_size = 4

# Perform simple random sampling
sample = random.sample(population, sample_size)

print("Sample:", sample)
```

- `population` is a list that represents your entire population. You can replace it with your actual population data.
- `sample_size` is the number of items you want in your sample.
- `random.sample(population, sample_size)` is used to randomly select `sample_size` elements from the list `population`.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the population
population = np.arange(1, 11) # Equivalent to a list from 1 to 10

# Specify the sample size
sample_size = 4

# Perform simple random sampling
sample = np.random.choice(population, size=sample_size, replace=False)

print("Sample:", sample)
```


  In this `numpy` example, `np.arange(1, 11)` generates an array of numbers from 1 to 10 and `np.random.choice()` is used for sampling. The `replace=False` argument ensures that the sampling is done without replacement, meaning the same element won't be chosen more than once.
  
## 2. Stratified Random Sampling

  ``` python
  import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def stratified_sampling(df, stratify_colname, n_samples):
    """
    Perform stratified random sampling on a DataFrame.

    Parameters:
    df (DataFrame): The DataFrame to sample from.
    stratify_colname (str): The name of the column to stratify by.
    n_samples (int): Total number of samples to return.

    Returns:
    DataFrame: A stratified sample DataFrame.
    """

    # Calculate the number of samples from each stratum
    n = df[stratify_colname].value_counts(normalize=True) * n_samples
    n = n.round().astype(int)

    # Get samples from each stratum
    stratified_sample = df.groupby(stratify_colname).apply(
  		lambda x: x.sample(n=x.name in n and n[x.name] or 0)).reset_index(drop=True)

    return stratified_sample

# Example usage
# Assuming you have a DataFrame 'df' and you want to stratify based on the column 'stratum_col'
# and you want a total of 100 samples
sample = stratified_sampling(df, 'stratum_col', 100)
print(sample)

  ```
  
## 3. Systematic Sampling  
  
  ```python
  import numpy as np

def systematic_sampling(data, sample_size):
    """
    Performs systematic sampling on a dataset.

    :param data: A list or array of data points (population).
    :param sample_size: The desired sample size.
    :return: A list containing the systematically sampled data points.
    """
    population_size = len(data)
    interval = population_size // sample_size
    start_point = np.random.randint(0, interval)

    # Select elements at regular intervals
    return data[start_point:population_size:interval]

# Example usage
population = np.arange(1, 101)  # an example population from 1 to 100
sample_size = 10
sample = systematic_sampling(population, sample_size)
print(sample)
  
  ```

 ## 4. Cluster Sampling
  
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Generate a sample dataset
# Let's create a DataFrame with 1000 samples and 
  #a 'Cluster_ID' column to indicate the cluster each sample belongs to.
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Sample_ID': range(1, 1001),
    'Measurement': np.random.randn(1000),
    'Cluster_ID': np.random.choice(['Cluster_1', 'Cluster_2',
  'Cluster_3', 'Cluster_4', 'Cluster_5'], 1000)
})

# Step 2: Divide data into clusters
# This step is already achieved in our synthetic dataset with 'Cluster_ID'

# Step 3: Randomly select a few clusters
# Let's say we randomly pick 2 clusters
selected_clusters = np.random.choice(data['Cluster_ID'].unique(), 2, replace=False)

# Step 4: Sample from the selected clusters
sampled_data = data[data['Cluster_ID'].isin(selected_clusters)]

# Display the sampled data
print(sampled_data)

  
  ```
 
  ## 5. Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) Sampling
  
  ```python

	import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def pps_sampling(dataframe, size_column, sample_size):
    """
    Perform Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling.

    Parameters:
    dataframe (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing the data.
    size_column (str): The name of the column that indicates the size measure.
    sample_size (int): The number of samples to draw.

    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the PPS sample.
    """
    # Calculate the total size
    total_size = dataframe[size_column].sum()

    # Calculate the probability for each row
    dataframe['Sampling_Probability'] = dataframe[size_column] / total_size

    # Perform sampling
    pps_sample = dataframe.sample(n=sample_size, replace=True, weights='Sampling_Probability')

    return pps_sample

# Example usage
data = {'ID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        'Size': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

sampled_df = pps_sampling(df, 'Size', 3)
print(sampled_df)


  ```
  
  ## 6. Convenience Sampling
  
  ```python
  	import pandas as pd
	import random

# Example: Suppose we have a dataset 'data.csv' with a column 'data_column'
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Selecting a convenience sample - for instance, the first 100 rows
convenience_sample = df.head(100)

# Alternatively, you can randomly select 
# 100 rows (this is a form of random sampling, not strictly convenience sampling)
random_sample = df.sample(100)

# Another example of convenience sampling 
#  could be selecting rows based on a certain accessible criterion
# For instance, selecting all rows where a certain column value meets a criterion
criteria_sample = df[df['some_column'] == 'some_value'].head(100)

# Note: In a real-world scenario, the criterion 
#for convenience sampling depends on what is easily accessible or convenient for the researcher.

  
  ```
  ## 7. Purposive Sampling
  
  ```python
  
  import pandas as pd

# Example dataset
data = {
    'ID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40, 45,
  50, 55, 60, 65, 70],
    'Income': [30000, 40000, 50000, 60000,
  70000, 80000, 90000, 100000, 110000, 120000]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define your selection criteria
# For example, select individuals who are between 40 and 60 years old
selected_df = df[(df['Age'] >= 40) & (df['Age'] <=60)]

print(selected_df)

```


  ## 8. Snowball Sampling
  
  ```python 
                                                      
    import pandas as pd

    # Example dataset
    data = {
        'ID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
        'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70],
        'Income': [30000, 40000, 50000, 60000, 70000, 80000, 90000, 100000, 110000, 120000]
    }

    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    # Define your selection criteria
    # For example, select individuals who are between 40 and 60 years old
    selected_df = df[(df['Age'] >= 40) & (df['Age'] <= 60)]

    print(selected_df)

```                                                    
                                                      
  ## 9. Quota Sampling                                                     

  ```python 
                                                          
    import pandas as pd

	def quota_sampling(dataframe, column, quotas):
    """
    Perform quota sampling on a DataFrame.

    Parameters:
    - dataframe (pd.DataFrame): The DataFrame to sample from.
    - column (str): The column based on which to form quotas.
    - quotas (dict): A dictionary with keys as 
  	- unique values of the column and values as the number of samples to take from each quota.

    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the sampled data.
    """

    # Ensuring quotas sum up to less than or equal to the dataframe length
    if sum(quotas.values()) > len(dataframe):
        raise ValueError("Total of quotas exceeds the number of available data points")

    # Sampling from each quota
    sampled_dfs = []
    for value, quota in quotas.items():
        df_quota = dataframe[dataframe[column] == value]
        sampled_dfs.append(df_quota.sample(n=min(quota, len(df_quota)), replace=False))

    # Concatenating the sampled data from each quota
    sampled_data = pd.concat(sampled_dfs, ignore_index=True)
    return sampled_data

# Example usage
# Assuming you have a DataFrame 'df' and you want to sample based on a column 'category'
# Let's say you want 10 samples from category A and 5 from category B

quotas = {'A': 10, 'B': 5}
sampled_df = quota_sampling(df, 'category', quotas)
  
```                                                     
  
  ## 10. Adaptive Sampling

  ```python
  
  import numpy as np

def adaptive_sampling(data, threshold):
    """
    Adaptive sampling based on the variance of the data.

    Parameters:
    data (list or np.array): The dataset to be sampled.
    threshold (float): The variance threshold for adaptive sampling.

    Returns:
    list: A list of sampled data points.
    """

    sampled_data = []
    window = []

    for point in data:
        window.append(point)
        
        if len(window) > 1:
            variance = np.var(window)

            if variance > threshold:
                sampled_data.append(point)
                window.clear()
    
    return sampled_data

# Example usage
data = np.random.randn(1000)  # Random data for demonstration
threshold = 0.5  # Set a variance threshold
sampled_data = adaptive_sampling(data, threshold)

print("Original data size:", len(data))
print("Sampled data size:", len(sampled_data))

  ```
 
  ## 11. Multistage Sampling
  
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Example dataset
data = {'id': range(1, 101), 'cluster': np.random.choice(['CityA',
  'CityB', 'CityC', 'CityD'], 100)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Step 1: Select a few clusters randomly
selected_clusters = np.random.choice(df['cluster'].unique(), 2, replace=False)

# Step 2: Sample from each selected cluster
sampled_data = pd.DataFrame()
for cluster in selected_clusters:
    cluster_data = df[df['cluster'] == cluster]
    sampled_data = sampled_data.append(cluster_data.sample(10))

# Result
print(sampled_data)
